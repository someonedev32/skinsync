<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles information when you use the AI SkinSync mobile application.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <strong>Summary:</strong>
  AI SkinSync is designed to minimize data collection. When you use the AI scan feature, we ask for your permission
  before sending data to a third-party AI provider to generate cosmetic skin analysis results. Optional content you choose to save
  (such as before/after photos) is stored locally on your device.
</div>

<div class="warn">
  <strong>Important (Third-party AI processing):</strong>
  If you enable AI analysis, the app transmits data to <strong>OpenAI</strong> via the OpenAI API to generate your cosmetic analysis results.
  The app requests <strong>explicit opt-in consent</strong> before any transmission.
</div>

<h2>1) Face Data (Face Photos) — Collection, Use, Sharing, Storage, Retention</h2>

<h3>1.1 What face data is processed</h3>
<p>
AI SkinSync may process a <strong>face photo</strong> captured by your device camera for the purpose of providing a
<strong>cosmetic skin analysis</strong> (e.g., dryness, redness, oiliness, texture, dark spots).
</p>

<h3>1.2 How face data is used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Face photos are used only to generate cosmetic analysis scores shown to you in the app.</li>
  <li>Face photos are <strong>not</strong> used for identification, authentication, or facial recognition.</li>
  <li>AI SkinSync does <strong>not</strong> create or store biometric identifiers or face templates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Sharing with third parties (AI processing)</h3>
<p>
To provide the AI analysis feature, AI SkinSync uses a third-party AI service. If you choose to enable AI analysis, the app may transmit the following data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data sent:</strong> the face photo you capture for cosmetic analysis (image data) and a short technical prompt needed to produce the analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipient:</strong> <strong>OpenAI, L.L.C.</strong> (via the OpenAI API).</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> generate your cosmetic skin analysis results displayed inside the app.</li>
  <li><strong>No advertising/tracking:</strong> we do not share face photos with third parties for advertising or tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4 User permission (opt-in before sending)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Before sending any data to OpenAI, the app shows a clear consent screen describing what data will be sent and to whom.</li>
  <li>If you decline, the AI analysis feature will not send your data to OpenAI and the analysis will not run.</li>
  <li>You can withdraw consent later by disabling AI analysis in the app settings (if available) or by not using the scan feature.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5 Where face data is stored</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>On our side:</strong> AI SkinSync does not store face photos on our servers.</li>
  <li><strong>On your device:</strong> the photo may exist temporarily in memory while you perform the scan.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-party processing:</strong> OpenAI receives the transmitted data to generate the analysis response.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.6 Retention (how long face data is kept)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>By AI SkinSync:</strong> face photos used for cosmetic analysis are processed in real time and are not retained by the app.</li>
  <li><strong>By OpenAI:</strong> OpenAI may retain API request/response data for a limited time for abuse monitoring and security, or as required by law.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Camera Permission</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync requests camera access only when you use the scan feature. If you deny camera access, scanning will not work.
You can change camera permission at any time in your device Settings.
</p>

<h2>3) Optional Before/After Photos (User-Selected Content)</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may offer an optional Before/After feature. If you choose to save Before/After photos:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> (local storage).</li>
  <li>They are <strong>not uploaded</strong> to our servers.</li>
  <li>You can remove them by deleting them within the app (if available) or by uninstalling the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) Local Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>
To provide core features, AI SkinSync may store certain non-sensitive app data locally on your device, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan results and timestamps (numeric scores, not the face photo)</li>
  <li>Progress history and comparisons</li>
  <li>Daily tips / routine completion (if enabled)</li>
  <li>Water tracker entries and targets</li>
  <li>Goals, streaks, achievements, and reminder preferences</li>
  <li>Purchase entitlement state (e.g., scan credits, last scan date, whether the free scan was used)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may offer optional in-app purchases (for example, additional scans).
All payments are processed by Apple through In-App Purchase.
We do not collect or store your payment card details.
</p>

<h2>6) Product Recommendations & Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may show skincare product recommendations and provide links to external product pages.
Some links may be <strong>affiliate links</strong>, meaning we may earn a commission if you purchase through those links, at no extra cost to you.
When you open an external link, the destination website’s privacy practices apply.
</p>

<h2>7) Analytics (Optional)</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may collect <strong>anonymous</strong> usage data (such as feature interactions) to improve performance and user experience.
This data is not intended to identify you and is not used for targeted advertising or tracking across other apps or websites.
</p>

<h2>8) Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>AI SkinSync does <strong>not</strong> collect or store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal contact information (name, email, phone number, physical address) unless you contact us directly</li>
  <li>Health or medical records (e.g., HealthKit / clinical records)</li>
  <li>Precise or coarse location data</li>
  <li>Contacts / address book data</li>
  <li>Biometric identifiers or face templates</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync is designed to minimize sensitive data handling. Face photos used for cosmetic analysis are not retained by the app.
Optional saved content (such as Before/After photos) and progress/habit data are stored locally on your device.
Data transmitted to third-party AI processing is sent over encrypted connections (TLS).
</p>

<h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us.
</p>

<h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in app features or data practices.
Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
