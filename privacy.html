<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>App:</strong> AI SkinSync<br>
<strong>Effective date:</strong> February 21, 2026</p>

<hr>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses,
discloses, and protects information when you use the AI SkinSync mobile application (the “App”).
By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
If you have questions, contact us at
<a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>2.1 Facial Photos Submitted by the User</h3>
<p>
When you choose to use the skin analysis feature, you may capture or upload a facial photo (selfie).
This photo is required to generate your skin analysis results.
</p>

<h3>2.2 Skin Analysis Results</h3>
<p>
The App generates analysis outputs derived from your photo (for example, detected skin attributes
and a summary report). These results may be stored to support app features such as viewing analysis
history.
</p>

<h3>2.3 Device and Usage Data</h3>
<p>
We may automatically collect limited technical information, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device type, operating system, and app version</li>
  <li>Crash reports and performance diagnostics</li>
  <li>Approximate network information (such as IP address) necessary for security and service delivery</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.4 Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> perform facial recognition.</li>
  <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store faceprints, facial geometry templates, or biometric identifiers used to identify individuals.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>3. How We Collect Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Directly from you:</strong> when you upload a photo or contact support.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatically:</strong> when you use the App (limited device and usage data).</li>
  <li><strong>Through permissions:</strong> camera or photo library access is requested only after your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>4. How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To generate AI-based skin analysis results</li>
  <li>To provide and maintain App functionality</li>
  <li>To allow optional access to analysis history</li>
  <li>To monitor performance, fix bugs, and improve reliability</li>
  <li>To respond to user support requests</li>
  <li>To protect the App from fraud, abuse, or security issues</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>5. Third-Party AI Processing (OpenAI)</h2>

<p>
To provide AI-based skin analysis, AI SkinSync transmits user-submitted facial photos to
<strong>OpenAI</strong> via its API over encrypted HTTPS/TLS connections.
OpenAI acts as a <strong>third-party data processor</strong> on our behalf.
</p>

<h3>5.1 Required Disclosure</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> Facial photo submitted by the user, plus minimal technical metadata required to process and return the analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Recipient:</strong> OpenAI (OpenAI API).</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> AI-based skin analysis only.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2 Use of Data by OpenAI</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Data sent through the OpenAI API is <strong>not used to train OpenAI models by default</strong>.</li>
  <li>OpenAI processes the data solely to generate the requested analysis response.</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3 Retention by OpenAI</h3>
<p>
According to OpenAI’s API data usage policy, OpenAI may retain API request and response data
(including user-submitted content) for up to <strong>30 days</strong> for abuse monitoring and safety purposes,
unless a Zero Data Retention or modified retention agreement is enabled.
</p>

<p>
AI SkinSync does not control OpenAI’s internal retention practices beyond the options made available
by OpenAI.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>6. Consent and User Control</h2>

<h3>6.1 Explicit In-App Consent</h3>
<p>
Before any photo is uploaded for analysis, the App displays a dedicated disclosure screen explaining:
what data is shared, who receives it, and for what purpose. You must explicitly consent (for example,
by tapping “I Agree &amp; Continue”) before any data is transmitted.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Permissions</h3>
<p>
After consent is given, iOS will request permission to access the camera or photo library.
You may change or revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Deletion</h3>
<p>
You can delete your photos and analysis results within the App where available, or request deletion
by contacting <a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Photos and results:</strong> retained only as needed to support App features (such as analysis history) and can be deleted by the user.</li>
  <li><strong>Account deletion or uninstall:</strong> associated data is deleted within 30 days, unless a longer retention period is required by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Technical logs:</strong> retained for a limited time for security and maintenance purposes.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect information, including encrypted
data transmission. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
</p>
