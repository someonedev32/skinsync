<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles information when you use our mobile application.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <strong>Short summary:</strong>
  AI SkinSync is designed to minimize data collection. Photos used for cosmetic skin analysis are processed in real time and are not stored by default.
  Optional before/after photos and habit/progress data can be stored locally on your device to support app features.
</div>

<h2>1) What AI SkinSync Does</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync provides cosmetic and informational tools such as:
cosmetic skin analysis scores, progress tracking, daily tips, routines, habit tracking (e.g., water), goals, reminders,
and product recommendations. The app does <strong>not</strong> provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
</p>

<h2>2) Camera & Photos</h2>

<h3>2.1 Cosmetic Skin Analysis</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The app may use your device camera to capture a photo for <strong>cosmetic skin analysis</strong> (e.g., dryness, redness, oiliness, texture, dark spots).</li>
  <li>Photos used for analysis are processed in real time and are <strong>not stored</strong> by the app.</li>
  <li>Analysis photos are <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties for advertising or tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Before / After Photos (Optional)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you choose to use the Before/After feature, you may save photos for personal visual comparison.</li>
  <li>These photos are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> (local storage).</li>
  <li>We do not upload Before/After photos to our servers.</li>
  <li>You can remove them by deleting them in the app (if available) or by uninstalling the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3) Local Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>
To provide core functionality, the app may store certain information locally on your device, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan results and progress history (numeric scores and timestamps)</li>
  <li>Daily tips history (if implemented)</li>
  <li>Water tracker entries and targets</li>
  <li>Goals, streaks, and routine completion data</li>
  <li>Reminder preferences</li>
  <li>Entitlement state for scan access (e.g., whether the free scan was used, last scan date, scan credits)</li>
</ul>
<p class="muted">
This data is used to show trends and improve your in-app experience and is stored locally unless explicitly stated otherwise.
</p>

<h2>4) Payments (In-App Purchases)</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may offer optional in-app purchases (for example, additional weekly scans). Payments are processed by Apple via In-App Purchase.
We do not collect your payment card details.
</p>

<h2>5) Product Recommendations & Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
<p>
The app may show recommended skincare products and provide links to external product pages.
Some links may be <strong>affiliate links</strong>, meaning we may earn a commission if you purchase through those links, at no extra cost to you.
When you open an external link, that website’s privacy practices apply.
</p>

<h2>6) Analytics (Optional)</h2>
<p>
We may collect <strong>anonymous</strong> usage data to understand app performance and improve user experience.
This data is not intended to identify you and is not used for targeted advertising.
</p>

<h2>7) Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>AI SkinSync does not collect or store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names, email addresses, phone numbers, or physical addresses (unless you contact us directly)</li>
  <li>Health or medical records (e.g., HealthKit/clinical records)</li>
  <li>Precise or coarse location</li>
  <li>Payment card numbers (payments are handled by Apple)</li>
  <li>Contacts/address book data</li>
</ul>

<h2>8) Permissions & Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera:</strong> You can deny or revoke camera access in your device settings. The scan feature requires camera permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can enable or disable reminders in device settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Deleting local data:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes locally stored app data from your device.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>
We aim to minimize data handling. Optional saved content (such as Before/After photos or habit tracking) is stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, contact us and we will address it.
</p>

<h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app’s features or data practices. The updated version will be posted on this page.
