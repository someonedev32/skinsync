<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">
This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> (“we”, “our”, or “the app”) handles information when you use the AI SkinSync mobile application.
</p>

<div class="box">
  <strong>Summary:</strong> AI SkinSync is designed to minimize data collection.
  Face photos used for cosmetic skin analysis are processed only to generate your cosmetic scores and are not retained by the app.
  Optional content you choose to save (such as before/after photos) is stored locally on your device.
</div>

<h2>1) Face Data (Face Photos) — Collection, Use, Sharing, Storage, Retention</h2>

<h3>1.1 What face data is processed</h3>
<p>
AI SkinSync may process a <strong>face photo</strong> captured by your device camera for the purpose of providing a
<strong>cosmetic skin analysis</strong> (e.g., dryness, redness, oiliness, texture, dark spots).
</p>

<h3>1.2 How face data is used</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Face photos are used only to generate cosmetic analysis scores shown to you in the app.</li>
  <li>Face photos are <strong>not</strong> used for identification, authentication, or facial recognition.</li>
  <li>AI SkinSync does <strong>not</strong> create or store biometric identifiers or face templates.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Sharing with third parties</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Face photos are <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties for advertising or tracking.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.4 Where face data is stored</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Face photos used for cosmetic analysis are <strong>not stored</strong> by AI SkinSync as user content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.5 Retention (how long face data is kept)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Face photos used for cosmetic analysis are processed in real time and are not retained by the app.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>The photo is discarded immediately after the analysis is completed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>2) Camera Permission</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync requests camera access only when you use the scan feature. If you deny camera access, scanning will not work.
You can change camera permission at any time in your device Settings.
</p>

<h2>3) Optional Before/After Photos (User-Selected Content)</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may offer an optional Before/After feature. If you choose to save Before/After photos:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>They are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> (local storage).</li>
  <li>They are <strong>not uploaded</strong> to our servers.</li>
  <li>You can remove them by deleting them within the app (if available) or by uninstalling the app.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4) Local Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>
To provide core features, AI SkinSync may store certain non-sensitive app data locally on your device, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Scan results and timestamps (numeric scores, not the face photo)</li>
  <li>Progress history and comparisons</li>
  <li>Daily tips / routine completion (if enabled)</li>
  <li>Water tracker entries and targets</li>
  <li>Goals, streaks, achievements, and reminder preferences</li>
  <li>Purchase entitlement state (e.g., scan credits, last scan date, whether the free scan was used)</li>
</ul>

<h2>5) In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may offer optional in-app purchases (for example, additional scans).
All payments are processed by Apple through In-App Purchase.
We do not collect or store your payment card details.
</p>

<h2>6) Product Recommendations & Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may show skincare product recommendations and provide links to external product pages.
Some links may be <strong>affiliate links</strong>, meaning we may earn a commission if you purchase through those links, at no extra cost to you.
When you open an external link, the destination website’s privacy practices apply.
</p>

<h2>7) Analytics (Optional)</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync may collect <strong>anonymous</strong> usage data (such as feature interactions) to improve performance and user experience.
This data is not intended to identify you and is not used for targeted advertising or tracking across other apps or websites.
</p>

<h2>8) Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>AI SkinSync does <strong>not</strong> collect or store:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal contact information (name, email, phone number, physical address) unless you contact us directly</li>
  <li>Health or medical records (e.g., HealthKit / clinical records)</li>
  <li>Precise or coarse location data</li>
  <li>Contacts / address book data</li>
  <li>Biometric identifiers or face templates</li>
</ul>

<h2>9) Security</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync is designed to minimize sensitive data handling. Face photos used for cosmetic analysis are not retained by the app.
Optional saved content (such as Before/After photos) and progress/habit data are stored locally on your device.
</p>

<h2>10) Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
AI SkinSync is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us.
</p>

<h2>11) Changes to This Policy</h2>

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in app features or data practices.
Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
