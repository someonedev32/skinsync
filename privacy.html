  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

  <h2>1 – Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    AI SkinSync (“we”, “us”, “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
    explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application
    <strong>AI SkinSync</strong>. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of
    information in accordance with this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2 – Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 – Device & Usage Data</h3>
  <p>
    We automatically collect technical and usage information about your device and how you use
    the App, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    <li>Unique device identifiers</li>
    <li>IP address and network data</li>
    <li>App usage and interaction logs</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 – Face Photos and Analysis Data</h3>
  <p>
    With your voluntary permission, the App collects and uploads facial photos for skin analysis.
    These photos are processed securely over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS) and analyzed to
    detect non-biometric skin attributes. We do NOT collect or store facial geometry, faceprints,
    embeddings, or any identifiers capable of recognizing a person. The photo is used solely for
    analysis purposes and results are generated without retaining the actual biometric data.
  </p>

  <h2>3 – How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    We use the information we collect for the following purposes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide and maintain the App’s features</li>
    <li>To analyze photos and generate personalized skin results</li>
    <li>To improve our services and app performance</li>
    <li>To communicate with users who contact support</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4 – Photo Uploads and Analysis</h2>
  <p>
    When you submit a selfie for analysis, the image is transmitted over secure encrypted
    connections to our backend for processing. We analyze the image only to derive non-biometric
    skin attributes (e.g., pores, wrinkles, acne). We do NOT store any facial identifiers or
    use them for any purpose other than generating your analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>5 – Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Photos and analysis results may be stored in our encrypted servers to support app features
    such as history. Each stored photo can be deleted by the user at any time through the
    App’s history feature. If the user deletes their account or uninstalls the App, all
    associated photos and analysis data will be deleted within 90 days.
  </p>

  <h2>6 – Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal information. We may share the information collected with trusted
    third-party service providers who assist in delivering app features (e.g., cloud hosting,
    analytics) under confidentiality obligations. Your face photos are not shared with third
    parties for commercial purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>7 – Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable security measures to protect the information we collect from
    unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet
    or electronic storage is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>8 – Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy within
    the App and on our website. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
  </p>

  <h2>9 – Contact Us</h2>

    us by email at <a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>.
