  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 19, 2026</p>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") collects,
      uses, stores, and protects information when you use the AI SkinSync mobile application
      ("the App"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Device & Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
      We automatically collect certain technical information about your device and how you use
      the App. This may include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>Unique identifiers (e.g., device ID)</li>
      <li>Usage patterns and analytics</li>
      <li>IP address and network data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.2 Facial Photos for Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      With your explicit permission, the App collects facial photos for skin analysis. These
      photos are processed securely over encrypted connections and used solely for generating
      results. The App does not collect or store biometric identifiers such as faceprints,
      facial geometry, or other uniquely identifying facial data.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and improve the features of the App</li>
      <li>To analyze skin attributes and generate personalized results</li>
      <li>For analytics and app performance monitoring</li>
      <li>To communicate with you if you contact support</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Face Data & Photo Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Facial photos you upload are used to derive analysis results (e.g., skin traits like pores,
      wrinkles, acne) and are transmitted over secure TLS/HTTPS connections to our servers. We do
      not retain any facial geometry or identifiers capable of recognizing an individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Photos processed by the service may be stored temporarily for basic analysis and display
      within the App history feature, and can be deleted by the user at any time. If an account
      is deleted or the App is uninstalled, all associated analysis data and photos will be
      removed from our servers within a reasonable time.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain personal information and usage data only as long as necessary to provide the
      App’s services and to fulfill operational or legal requirements. Data can be removed upon
      user request where applicable.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. We may share information with
      third-party service providers (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics partners) solely to support
      App functionality and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect
      the data we collect. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.
    </p>
  </section>

      Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding access, correction, deletion,

      rights.
    </p>
