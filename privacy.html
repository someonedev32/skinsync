<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
SkinSync values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the SkinSync mobile application.
</p>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Summary:</strong> SkinSync is designed to minimize data collection.
  Skin analysis photos used for scanning are not stored. Optional before/after photos can be stored locally on your device for personal comparison.
</div>

<h2>What SkinSync Does</h2>
<p>
SkinSync provides cosmetic and informational features such as skin analysis scores, progress tracking, daily tips, habit tracking (e.g., water tracker and streaks), goals, reminders, and product recommendations.
SkinSync does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
</p>

<h2>Camera & Photos</h2>

<h3>1) Skin Analysis (Scan)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>SkinSync uses your camera to capture a photo for cosmetic skin analysis (Dryness, Redness, Oiliness, Texture, Dark Spots).</li>
  <li>Scan photos are used only for real-time analysis and are <strong>not stored</strong> by SkinSync.</li>
  <li>Scan photos are <strong>not sent to our servers</strong> and are <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Before / After Photos (Optional)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If you choose to use the Before/After feature, you may save comparison photos.</li>
  <li>These photos are stored <strong>only on your device</strong> (local storage) for your personal visual comparison.</li>
  <li>Before/After photos are <strong>not transmitted</strong> to our servers and are <strong>not shared</strong> with third parties.</li>
  <li>You can remove these photos by deleting them within the app (or by removing the app from your device).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Local Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
<p>
To provide core features, SkinSync stores certain non-sensitive app data locally on your device, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Scan history & progress scores</strong> (e.g., the numeric results for each metric)</li>
  <li><strong>Water tracker</strong> entries (daily cups/targets)</li>
  <li><strong>Goals</strong> you set and your progress tracking</li>
  <li><strong>Streaks / achievements</strong> used for motivation</li>
  <li><strong>Reminder settings</strong> (your chosen schedules)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This local data is used to show trends and improve your in-app experience. It is not linked to your identity unless you provide identifying information separately (SkinSync does not require an account by default).
</p>

<h2>Daily Tips & Weather Tips</h2>
<p>
SkinSync may show daily skincare tips and weather-related tips.
These are informational, cosmetic tips intended for general use and do not constitute medical advice.
</p>

<h2>Product Recommendations & External Links</h2>
<p>
SkinSync may recommend skincare products and provide links that open external websites (for example, product pages).
When you open an external link, the destination website’s privacy practices apply.
</p>

<h2>Analytics (Optional)</h2>
<p>
SkinSync may collect <strong>anonymous</strong> usage data (for example, feature taps or product interaction) to improve app performance and user experience.
This data is not linked to your identity and is not used for targeted advertising or tracking across other apps or websites.
</p>

<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
<p>
SkinSync does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or process:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personal contact information (name, email, phone number, physical address)</li>
  <li>Health or medical records (HealthKit/clinical records)</li>
  <li>Precise or coarse location data</li>
  <li>Financial or payment information</li>
  <li>Contacts/address book data</li>
  <li>Advertising identifiers for tracking</li>
</ul>

<h2>Permissions & Your Choices</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Camera:</strong> You can deny or revoke camera access in your device settings. The scan feature requires camera permission.</li>
  <li><strong>Notifications (Reminders):</strong> You can enable/disable reminders at any time in your device settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Local data:</strong> You can remove local data by uninstalling the app. If the app provides in-app delete options, you can also delete stored items there.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
SkinSync is designed to minimize sensitive data handling. Optional Before/After photos and habit data are stored locally on your device. We do not store scan photos on servers.
</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
SkinSync is not intended for children. If you believe a child has provided information to us, please contact us and we will address it appropriately.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app’s features or data practices. Updates will be posted on this page with a revised “Last updated” date.
