  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>App:</strong> AI SkinSync &nbsp;|&nbsp; <strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-02-21</p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Summary (Key Compliance Points)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data shared for analysis:</strong> A user-submitted facial photo (selfie) and minimal technical metadata needed to deliver the service.</li>
      <li><strong>Recipient:</strong> A third-party AI processing provider acting as our data processor (name listed below).</li>
      <li><strong>Consent:</strong> We ask for your permission in-app before any photo is uploaded to the third-party AI service, and iOS camera permission is requested only after you consent.</li>
      <li><strong>No biometric identification:</strong> We do not perform facial recognition and do not create/store faceprints or biometric identifiers for identification.</li>
      <li><strong>Control:</strong> You can delete your photos/results and request deletion via email.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>AI SkinSync</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects
    information when you use the AI SkinSync application (the “App”).
  </p>
  <p>
    Contact: <a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>
  </p>

  <h2>2. What We Collect</h2>

  <h3>2.1 User-Submitted Photos (Skin Analysis Input)</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to use the skin analysis feature, you may capture or upload a facial photo (selfie).
    This photo is used to generate a skin analysis report.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 Analysis Outputs</h3>
  <p>
    We generate and store the analysis outputs associated with your photo (for example: detected skin attributes and the resulting report)
    to provide the feature and optional history within the App.
  </p>

  <h3>2.3 Device & Usage Data</h3>
  <p>We may automatically collect limited technical data, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type, operating system version, app version</li>
    <li>Crash logs and performance diagnostics</li>
    <li>Approximate network data (e.g., IP address) used for security and service delivery</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.4 What We Do Not Collect</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your photo for facial recognition or identity verification.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store “faceprints”, facial geometry templates, or biometric identifiers used to uniquely identify you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Collect Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Directly from you:</strong> when you capture/upload a photo or contact support.</li>
    <li><strong>Automatically:</strong> when you use the App (limited device/usage data).</li>
    <li><strong>From your device permissions:</strong> camera/photos access is requested by iOS only when you choose to use those features.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To provide skin analysis and generate your results</li>
    <li>To maintain optional history (if enabled) and allow you to view/delete prior results</li>
    <li>To monitor performance, fix bugs, and improve reliability</li>
    <li>To respond to support inquiries</li>
    <li>To protect the App from fraud, abuse, and security incidents</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing (Third-Party AI Service)</h2>
  <p>
    To deliver AI-based skin analysis, the App transmits certain data to a third-party AI processing provider that acts as our <strong>data processor</strong>.
    Data is transmitted over encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS).
  </p>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Required Disclosure (What / Who / Permission)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What data is sent:</strong> the facial photo you submit for skin analysis, plus minimal technical metadata required to process and return results.</li>
      <li><strong>Who receives the data:</strong> <strong>OpenAI OpCo LLC</strong> (the “AI Provider”).</li>
      <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> to process the photo and return skin analysis outputs to AI SkinSync.</li>
      <li><strong>Permission:</strong> the App requests your explicit in-app consent <em>before</em> uploading any photo to the AI Provider, and you may decline.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h3>5.1 AI Provider Restrictions (Processor Terms)</h3>
  <p>
    The AI Provider processes data only on our behalf and under contractual obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    The AI Provider is not permitted to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use photos for advertising or unrelated purposes</li>
    <li>Use photos to identify you (no facial recognition)</li>
    <li>Sell your personal data</li>
    <li>Share your photos with other third parties except as necessary to provide the processing service (and only under equal or stronger protections)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Consent & Controls</h2>

  <h3>6.1 In-App Consent Before Upload</h3>
  <p>
    Before the first time you use skin analysis, the App shows a disclosure screen explaining:
    what data is shared, who it is shared with, and why. You must tap an explicit consent action
    (e.g., “I Agree &amp; Continue”) before any upload occurs.
  </p>

  <h3>6.2 iOS Permissions</h3>
  <p>
    iOS will ask for permission to access your camera/photos. You can change these permissions at any time in your device settings.
  </p>

  <h3>6.3 Deletion</h3>
  <p>
    You can delete your photos and analysis results within the App (where available). You may also request deletion by emailing
    <a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain photos and analysis outputs only as long as needed to provide the service and optional history features, or as required by law.
    We apply the following retention rules:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Photos and results:</strong> retained only for feature support (e.g., history) and can be deleted by the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Account deletion / uninstall:</strong> associated photos and results are deleted within <strong>30 days</strong>, unless a longer period is required by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> retained for a limited period to maintain and secure the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect data, including encrypted transmission (HTTPS/TLS).
    No system is 100% secure, but we aim to reduce risk through access controls and least-privilege practices.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Your data may be processed in countries other than your own, depending on where we and our service providers operate.
    Where applicable, we use appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect
    personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us to request deletion.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your personal data.
    To exercise rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@inovation.app">support@inovation.app</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy on this page and update the effective date.
    Material changes may also be communicated within the App.
